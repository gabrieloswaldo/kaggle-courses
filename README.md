# Kaggle Courses
This repository contains the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview" target="_blank">free courses from Kaggle</a> that i am currently doing to start my journey in Data Science!

**I do not own this material**, i have just copied the content into personal notebooks to use and test things myself.

By the way, if you came to this notebook and are trying to enter this world of data like me, i recommend these two articles on Medium, which have been my guides along this path.
